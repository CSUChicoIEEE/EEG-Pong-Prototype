This is the Alpha build for the 2 player pong EEG software suite.

We are achieving this with 2 openBCI headsets built from scratch
with the help of OSHpark/Digi-Key for PCB manufacturing and 
components.

Included in this EEG software suite is UCSD's EEGlab software
and BCIlab which we are using for EEG data processing.

We are also using a MATLAB pong game created by David Buckingham
with some modifications to implement EEG control with eye movement.

This project will be continously udpated and will have two different
version. One version will be a stable release and the other will be
a developer version.
