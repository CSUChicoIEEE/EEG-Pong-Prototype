Abstract: 

The goal of this project is to have two users with openBCI headsets 
transmitting wireless biopotential data via bluetooth to a network streaming layer. 
The networking streaming layer then takes that data into BCIlab where it is then processed 
in EEGlab with plugins to identify eye movements. Once the data is procesed it will be used 
to control an individual pong paddle for each player in real time within a modified MATLAB pong game.
===========================================================================================================
Contents:

Inside the project are various folders containing different software.

Mark IV EEG Headset STL Files is the folder containing all the CAD files for 3D printing.

OpenBCI Cyton Firmware folder contains the raw firmware data needed to be flashed to the openBCI
Cyton board.

The Python Project Folder contains all the files needed to run the game in the PyCharm IDE.
